# MCMC-Simulator
A Python implementation of a Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (APC) model using PyMC for epidemiological or demographic analysis. The model estimates the effects of age, period, and cohort on observed event counts (e.g., disease cases) using Poisson likelihood and MCMC sampling, with synthetic data generation for demonstration.
